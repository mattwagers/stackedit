# About this book

This text has been compiled for use in the Linguistic Department's course _Language and the Mind_ at UC Santa Cruz. It is a hybrid course notes & sourcebook developed from materials introduced and refined by various instructors over the years including: 
- Pranav Anand
- Jim McCloskey
- Matt Wagers

LING80D was historically titled "Language and Mind: Chomsky's Program." While there are many excellent separate treatments of the topics we cover in LING80D, we could find no text that binds them together at the right level, suitable for an undergraduate survey with no presupposed exposure in linguistics or cognitive science.
